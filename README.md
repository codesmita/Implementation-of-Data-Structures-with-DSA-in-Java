*Implementation-of-Data-Structures-with-DSA-in-Java* is intended to implement various basic data structures that are optimal in efficiency and common in computer science. The project methodology is therefore taken step by step from the start to the end.
*Project Essentials*
The project is stated as follows:
- Implement various basic data structures, i.e., linked lists, stacks, queues, trees and hash tables, in Java using the concepts of DSA.
  
Key Features
- Each Data Structure application will provide support for the basic operations insertion, deletion, and searching.
- Sorting and searching algorithms will be implemented based on the data structure.
- Furthermore, a thorough set of JUnit tests will be included to test the correctness of each implemented structure.
  
*Skills Developed:*
- Basic understanding and hands-on experience of DSA concepts.
- Strong grasp on core Java programming and object-oriented designs.
- Enhance data structures and algorithms in terms of time and space efficiency.
  
*Usage:*
- Document the operation of each data structure, the algorithm the basics on which it is based, and the time and space complexities.
- Usage and example snippets depicting how to use each structure with real-world examples.
# Additional Considerations
- *Efficiency:* Optimal time and space complexity of data structure operations should be targeted.
- *Error Handling:* Provide proper handling robust against edge cases.
- *Performance Analysis:* Benchmarks and performance analysis should be included to provide beacon to understand their efficiency and scalability.
